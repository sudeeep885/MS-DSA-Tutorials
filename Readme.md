* We, the MS in CSE students at IIT-Madras, have developed a collaborative learning approach where we conduct peer-led lectures on Data Structures and Algorithms to reinforce our understanding of these concepts. This model is based on mutual growth and support, where each student helps others to grow and improve their knowledge. (This repo contains the code used in lectures.)

* Beyond these lectures, we also participate in a daily problem-solving exercise where each student independently solves a question posted by their peer. At the end of the day, the original poster shares their approach and thought process with the group during a meeting, allowing for a collective discussion and exchange of ideas.
